# Enhanced Location-Based Event System 🎯

## What's New

Your event discovery system has been significantly improved with enhanced location parsing and search capabilities.

### ✅ Improvements Made

#### 1. **Smart Location Parsing** 
- **Before**: "Madhapur, Hyderabad, Telangana, India" was stored as one city name
- **After**: Parsed into clean components: City="Hyderabad", State="Telangana", Country="India"

#### 2. **Enhanced Search Functions**
- **Partial Matching**: Search "Hyderabad" and find events in "Madhapur, Hyderabad"
- **Flexible Queries**: Search by area, city, or state names
- **Priority Ranking**: Exact matches appear first, then partial matches

#### 3. **Data Cleanup**
- **71 events** have been automatically cleaned and re-parsed
- Added database indexes for faster search performance
- Improved location-based queries

#### 4. **Better Search Coverage**
- Enhanced search radius: Now searches up to 500km for rural areas
- Smart fallback: Automatically expands search if no local events found
- Multiple country support with expanded city lists

### 🔧 Technical Improvements

- `clean_existing_location_data`: Automated data cleanup

#### Enhanced Edge Functions
